## Monte-Carlo Localization (MCL)

### MCL

The MCL implementation can be found in MCL directory which contains all the necessary
classes for the MCL implementation.

Please treat the MCL folder as a module and use the `main.py` script **outside the MCL directory**.
At the start of the `main` script I left the `import` commands for the MCL implementation
and an example for using the `MCL` class.

### Report

The source code for the report can be found next to the required pdf file.

### Inspect

The scripts for the inspection of the MCL I did in the report.
In the report I show only the results and in the Inspect folder you can also
see the script themself.

Thanks!
