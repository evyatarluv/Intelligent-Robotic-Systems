## Monte Carlo Localization (MCL)

### MCL Directory

The MCL implementation can be found in MCL directory which contains all the necessary
classes for the MCL implementation.

Please treat the MCL folder as a module and use the `main.py` script **outside the MCL directory**.
At the start of the `main` script I left the `import` commands for the MCL implementation
and an example for using the `MCL` class.

### Files Explanation

1. `main.py` - Example of using the MCL class.

1. `MCL_Report.ipynb` - Source code of the notebook

1. `inspect_MCL.py` - The inspection's script I mentions in the report.

Thanks!
