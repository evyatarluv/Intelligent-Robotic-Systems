# Intelligent Robotic Systems

This repos consist on different implementation for intellegence 
systems.

The localization algorithms Extended Kalman Filter and Monte-Carlo Localization
can be found in the EFK and MCL directories respectively.
Each implementation contain also an report for describing the
implementation and the results.

You can use each implementation as a python module and import it to
your script.
